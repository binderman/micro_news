# Micro News: A Multi-Language Server API Project 

Welcome to Micro News, a diverse project that showcases how to build a server API across different programming languages and platforms. This repository contains implementations of the same server in Python, Java, Node.js, Rust, and C#. These servers provide an API for news using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). 

As of now, there is a React frontend provided to consume the API from the servers. The future plan is to add frontends in Angular, SwiftUI, Android, and Flutter. The primary objective is to highlight the differences between languages and platforms, giving users a comprehensive look into their unique features, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Servers

The servers are implemented in the following languages:

- Python
- Java
- Node.js
- Rust
- C#

Each server acts as an intermediary, fetching news from NewsAPI and delivering it to the frontends.

## Frontends

Presently, the project includes a frontend developed using:

- React

In the future, we plan to extend the frontend implementations to:

- Angular
- SwiftUI (iOS App)
- Android (Native App)
- Flutter 

This will provide an opportunity to compare different frontend technologies and platforms.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Highlight the differences between various server-side languages and frontend technologies.
- Provide a hands-on comparison of different languages/platforms from the perspective of implementing the same functionality.
- Serve as a resource for developers to understand the nuances of different programming languages and platforms.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and learn!
